  abstract = {Saharan dust input and seasonal upwelling along North–West Africa provide a model system for studying microbial processes related to the export and recycling of nutrients. This study offers the first molecular characterization of prokaryotic particleattached (PA; {$>$}3.0 µm) and free-living (FL; 0.2–3.0 µm) players in this important ecosystem during August 2016. Environmental drivers for alpha-diversity, bacterial community composition, and differences between FL and PA fractions were identified. The ultra-oligotrophic waters off Senegal were dominated by Cyanobacteria while higher relative abundances of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes (known particle-degraders) occurred in the upwelling area. Temperature, proxy for different water masses, was the best predictor for changes in FL communities. PA community variation was best explained by temperature and ammonium. Bray Curtis dissimilarities between FL and PA were generally very high and correlated with temperature and salinity in surface waters. Greatest similarities between FL and PA occurred at the deep chlorophyll maximum, where bacterial substrate availability was likely highest. This indicates that environmental drivers do not only influence changes among FL and PA communities but also differences between them. This could provide an explanation for contradicting results obtained by different studies regarding the dissimilarity/similarity between FL and PA communities and their biogeochemical functions.},

  abstract = {Summary: The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) and associated taxonomic classification toolkit (GTDB-Tk) have been widely adopted by the microbiology community. However, the growing size of the GTDB bacterial reference tree has resulted in GTDB-Tk requiring substantial amounts of memory ( 320 GB) which limits its adoption and ease of use. Here, we present an update to GTDB-Tk that uses a divide-and-conquer approach where user genomes are initially placed into a bacterial reference tree with family-level representatives followed by placement into an appropriate class-level subtree comprising species representatives. This substantially reduces the memory requirements of GTDB-Tk while having minimal impact on classification.},

  abstract = {Summary                            In recent years, microbial ecology has developed from a peripheral discipline into a central field of microbiology. This change in state and perception is mainly driven by a rapid development of methods applied in the manifold fields related to microbial ecology. In biogeochemistry, for example, the use of high‐resolution techniques such as FT‐ICR‐MS (Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectroscopy) has uncovered an enormous diversity and complexity of natural organic matter produced or degraded microbially either in dissolved or particulate forms. On the other hand, the introduction of high‐throughput sequencing methods, such as 454 pyrosequencing, in combination with advances in bioinformatics allows for studying the bacterial diversity in natural samples circumventing cultivation dependent approaches. These new molecular tools enable in depth studies on single‐cell genomes, distinct populations or even metacommunities. In combination with metatranscriptome and proteome studies it is for the first time possible to simultaneously unravel the structure and function of complex communities               in situ               . These technique‐derived findings have, on the one hand, dramatically increased our knowledge on the vast diversity and complexity of bacterial habitats and, on the other hand, on phylogentic diversity and physiological responses of natural bacterial communities to their environment. However, until now microbial ecology is lacking an ecologically relevant species definition and useful tools for the identification of ecologically coherent taxa. Studies on intra‐ and interspecies interactions even with higher organisms demonstrate that bacteria can rapidly adapt to temporal and spatial changes in their environment. Aquatic bacteria have optimized and dramatically expanded their living space by efficient exploitation of organic matter point sources such as particles/aggregates and higher organisms. Although it is evident that particles/aggregates and organisms such as phytoplankton are ‘hotspots’ for microbial growth and transformation processes, it has not affected sampling strategies of aquatic microbial ecologists, who often focus solely on the free‐living bacterial fractions and               a priori               exclude higher organisms by non‐representative water sampling. Therefore, aquatic microbial ecologists have largely overlooked the fact that many aquatic bacteria may possess a complex lifestyle and frequently alternate between a free‐living and a surface‐associated stage. Here, I propose that modern concepts in aquatic microbial ecology should take into account the high chemical diversity and spatio‐temporal variability of the bacterial environment. Interactions of aquatic bacteria with surfaces including living organisms are the key to understanding their physiological adaptations and population dynamics, as well as their contribution to biogeochemical cycles. New sampling strategies and theoretical concepts are needed in aquatic microbial ecology to access the whole spectrum of bacterial lifestyles and their ecological and evolutionary consequences.},

  abstract = {The study of metagenomics has been much benefited from low-cost and high-throughput sequencing technologies, yet the tremendous amount of data generated make analysis like de novo assembly to consume too much computational resources. In late 2014 we released MEGAHIT v0.1 (together with a brief note of Li et al. (2015) [1]), which is the first NGS metagenome assembler that can assemble genome sequences from metagenomic datasets of hundreds of Giga base-pairs (bp) in a time- and memoryefficient manner on a single server. The core of MEGAHIT is an efficient parallel algorithm for constructing succinct de Bruijn Graphs (SdBG), implemented on a graphical processing unit (GPU). The software has been well received by the assembly community, and there is interest in how to adapt the algorithms to integrate popular assembly practices so as to improve the assembly quality, as well as how to speed up the software using better CPU-based algorithms (instead of GPU).},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic communities commonly display a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) but the results have been mixed when assessed in bacterial communities. Habitat heterogeneity, a factor in eukaryotic BEFs, may explain these variable observations but it has not been thoroughly evaluated in bacterial communities. Here, we examined the impact of habitat on the relationship between diversity assessed based on the (phylogenetic) Hill diversity metrics and heterotrophic productivity. We sampled co-occurring free-living (more homogenous) and particle-associated (more heterogeneous) bacterial habitats in a freshwater, estuarine lake over three seasons: spring, summer and fall. There was a strong, positive, linear relationship between particle-associated bacterial richness and heterotrophic productivity that strengthened when considering dominant taxa. There were no observable BEF trends in free-living bacterial communities for any diversity metric. Biodiversity, richness and Inverse Simpson’s index, were the best predictors of particle-associated production whereas pH was the best predictor of free-living production. Our findings show that heterotrophic productivity is positively correlated with the effective number of taxa and that BEF relationships are associated with microhabitats. These results add to the understanding of the highly distinct contributions to diversity and functioning contributed by bacteria in free-living and particle-associated habitats.},
