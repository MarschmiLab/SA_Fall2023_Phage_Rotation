# Comments on BBM Poster

- I recommend adding a photo of yourself (so people can recognize the presenter) and also a lab logo. :)  
- I removed extra white space in the intro sections.  
- Check out some citations from [John Kelly](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0BTS418AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for the introduction. And for your perusal for idea generation related to your thesis!  
- Add citations to some of the methods section (see my poster).  
- Can you make the phylogenies bigger so it's easier to see the outside? I recommend:  
		- Which row of information is the phylum vs antibiotic genes? Right now, the color palettes are quite similar and it's hard to tell. Please include figure legends. 
		- Moving the phylogeny legends to the side of the boxplots to make more space. 
- Antibiotic resistance genes: THe title states that generalist species encode the most but it appears that the particle associated also have many (though fewer MAGs). Please be specific here. What about the particle MAGs?  
- Can the inside of the phylogenies have less thick lines? (The inside of the circles). 
- The Pagel's lambda and bloomberg's K can have 3 significant digits. No need to include 6 in both the value and pvalue (it takes up a lot space but communicates the same information. Are 6 significant digits are important?)   
- Currently, the writing under future directions is vague. Can you add more specific language? Specifically: "Analyze if lifestyle is better predictor of phage infection rather than phylogeny". "Explore potential vectores of anthropogenic disturbances such as plastic pollution..." 
- It'd be great to update the title to be more active based on your results. :) How might you add some of your conclusions to modify your title?  
- I LOVE the "16.5% of MAGs encode antibiotic resistance genes" Can you add this to the other two figures?? 
- Are the phylogenies subsetted? If so, please be sure to include this information. 

I've edited the middle section to increase the size of the plots. This could be helpful to do for the other two phylogenies.
