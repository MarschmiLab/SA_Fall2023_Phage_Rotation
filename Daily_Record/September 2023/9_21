I. Objective
  - Yesterday I created a bash script (in my code directory called rename_geNomad.sh) that would input all 346 MAGs and submit through geNomad as opposed to doing it individually
  - Today I will:
    1. Run the 346 MAGs through the terminal
    2. Begin analysis of the output file
    3. Install screen or tmux


II. Protocol 
1. In server I will be running the 346 MAGs through my script (located in my code directory) called geNomad_processing.sh
2. The results will be placed into an output file called "genomad_output: which is located in Output/


III. Future goals
1. I will continue my analysis through Rstudio and create Rmarkdown files to display my analysis and results
