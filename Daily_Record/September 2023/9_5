Objective: Install geNomad and download the database

Purpose: geNomad will be used to identify viruses and plasmids in sequencing data. Has additional features like taxonomic assignment of viral genomes, identifying proviruses, and functional annonation of proteins. 

Protocol:
1. install geNomad 
  - so far conda and pipx were unsuccessful for me to install
  - I was able to successfully install with docker

2. Downloading the database
  - geNomad depends on a database that contains profile markers to classify sequences, taxonomic info, functional annonations, etc.
  - this was done on docker and I did not need to download the database it already did it for me when I installed it first

Future goals:
- use the practice FASTA file given on the geNomad website and follow the example
- learn how to execute the command
- learn how to understand the genomad_output directory
