I have uploaded (or am uploading) my figures that I have created from Rstudio. To understand exactly what is going on, please refer to my Rmarkdown file so that way you can understand how I made these figures and what went into making them. They come from the 346_MAG_analysis.Rmd and from the individual_assembly.Rmd files

I sincerely hope that the code that I used makes sense and if not I apologize. Please let me know if you have any questions:)
